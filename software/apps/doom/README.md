This is a port of DOOM to the Nyuzi architecture. This doesn't utilize many 
advanced features of the architecture like vector arithmetic or hardware 
threading  (even floating point is used only in a few spots), but it 
is a good test of the toolchain, as it is fairly large (50k lines of code, 
compiled to 300k). 

A shareware WAD file is required to use this. This is not included in this
repository, but can be found pretty easily with a Google search. It should be 
named "doom1.wad" and placed in this directory.

To run (in the emulator) type 'make run'.  This does not currently run on FPGA
because there isn't a mass storage device to store the WAD.

The primary changes I made for the port were:

* In w_wad.c, read the WAD file directly from a simulated block device. Since 
this is running on bare metal with a minimal libc, there is no filesystem layer. 
I commented out other code that interacted with the filesystem (for example, 
saving and restoring games). The size of the WAD file is hardcoded in this file.
* in i_video.c, added code to copy the screen to the framebuffer, expanding 
from an 8 bit paletted format to the 32 bit per pixel framebuffer format.
* in i_video.c, reads from a virtual keyboard device for input.
* Fixed some places that made bad assumptions that the hardware supported 
unaligned memory accesses.
* Code from i_net and i_sound mostly removed, since there's no support for 
them.
