# How to Contribute

Patches are welcome. This is a broad project with many components, 
both software and hardware. Here are some examples of areas to
help out, which are by no means exhaustive:

1. Hardware - Improve performance, increase clock speed, reduce area, 
   add new instructions or memory mapped fixed function blocks. Synthesize 
   for other FPGAs or ASICs (fix errors, add build scripts and config files)
2. Verification - Create new tests and test frameworks, improve existing ones.
3. Compiler - Improve code generation, port other language frontends 
   (especially parallel languages).
4. Tools - Improve and implement new profiling, visualization, and performance 
   measurement tools.
5. Benchmarks - A variety of benchmarks help evaluate instruction set or 
   microarchitectural tradeoffs. There are many libraries of parallel benchmarks
   that could be ported.
6. Software - Optimize or add capabilities to librender, implement a raytracer, 
   port games or demo effects (which do double duty as a tests and benchmarks)

# Submitting Changes

Please read the sections about testing and coding style below. Larger
architectural changes or features should be proposed on the
[Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nyuzi-processor-dev)

There are a number of [good pages](https://help.github.com/) on how to use github's standard pull
request workflow. Here is a brief summary of how to do this from the command line:

First, set up your repository:

1. Fork the repo: From the main page, press the 'fork' button in the upper
right corner: https://github.com/jbush001/NyuziProcessor

2. Clone this to your local machine (replacing YOUR-USERENAME below with your
github login) and the main project as an upstream so you can sync the latest
changes:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/NyuziProcessor
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/jbush001/NyuziProcessor
   ```

To submit a change:

1. Make sure your master branch is up to date if you haven't updated recently:

   ```
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

2. Make a new topic branch for each submission:

   ```
   git checkout -b my-new-feature
   ```   

3. Make changes and check into your local repository.
4. Push the change to your fork on github

   ```
   git push origin my-new-feature
   ```
  
5. Follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) 
to create a pull request: 

When a pull request has been accepted, you can sync it to your master branch
as described in step 1 above.

# Testing Changes

When adding new features, add tests as necessary to the tests/cosimulation
directory. A README in that directory describes how. In addition, here are
some tests that should be run to check for regressions (depending on what 
was changed):

1. Directed cosimulation tests - Switch to the tests/cosimulation directory

   ```
   $ ./runtest.sh *.s
   Building branch.s
   Random seed is 1411615294
   44 total instructions executed
   PASS
   ...
   ```

2. Random cosimulation tests - Randomized tests aren't checked into the 
tree, but it's easy to create a bunch and run them.  From tests/cosimulation:

   ```
   $ ./generate_random.py -m 25
   generating random0000.s
   generating random0001.s
   ...
   $ ./runtest.sh random*.s
   Building random0000.s
   Random seed is 1411615265
   496347 total instructions executed
   PASS
   ```

3. Compiler tests - change to the tests/compiler directory. 

   ```bash
   $ ./runtest.sh 
   Testing atomic.cpp at -O0
   PASS
   Testing atomic.cpp at -O3 -fno-inline
   PASS
   ...
   ```

   By default, these run against the emulator. The can also be run against the 
   hardware model to validate hardware changes:

   ```bash
   USE_VERILATOR=1 ./runtest.sh
   ```

4. 3D renderer - Execute tests in tests/render. Each will produce output.png.
Ensure it doesn't hang. Each directory contains an image reference.png which shows 
what the result should look like (which must be manually comapred right now). 
This can takes 4-5 minutes. 

   ```
   $ make verirun
   ...
  ***HALTED***
   ran for    16223433 cycles
   performance counters:
    l2_writeback                    56646
    l2_miss                        162023
   ...
   ```   

5. Synthesize for FPGA - The Quartus synthesis tools catch different types of errors 
than Verilator.  Also check:
 * Open rtl/fpga/de2-115/output_files/fpga_target.map.summary and check the 
 total number of logic elements to ensure the design still fits on the part 
 and the number of logic elements hasn't gone up excessively (it should be 
 around 73k)

   ```
   Analysis & Synthesis Status : Successful - Wed Sep 10 18:51:56 2014
   Quartus II 32-bit Version : 13.1.0 Build 162 10/23/2013 SJ Web Edition
   Revision Name : fpga_target
   Top-level Entity Name : fpga_top
   Family : Cyclone IV E
   Total logic elements : 73,327
   ```

 * Open rtl/fpga/de2-115/output_files/fpga_target.sta.rpt and find the maximum 
 frequency for clk50 to ensure the timing hasn't regressed (it should be around 
 60Mhz at 85C):

   ```
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+
   ; Slow 1200mV 85C Model Fmax Summary                        ;
   +------------+-----------------+---------------------+------+
   ; Fmax       ; Restricted Fmax ; Clock Name          ; Note ;
   +------------+-----------------+---------------------+------+
   ; 61.22 MHz  ; 61.22 MHz       ; clk50               ;      ;
   ...
   ```
 
6. For compiler and emulator changes, compile and execute software/doom.
 
# Coding Style

When in doubt, be conistent. The OpenCores guidelines give a good set of
rules, which this project generally follows (with some exceptions, which 
should be obvious)

http://cdn.opencores.org/downloads/opencores_coding_guidelines.pdf

A few other conventions are used in this project:

- Use `logic` to define nets and flops rather than `reg` and `wire`
- For non-generic components, make the instance name be the same as the component name<br>
   No:

   ```SystemVerilog
   writeback_stage wback(
   ```

   Yes:

   ```SystemVerilog
   writeback_stage writeback_stage(
   ```

- Use verilog-2001 style port definitions, specifying direction and type in one definition. Group module ports by source/destination and add a comment for each group. Signals that go between non-generic components should be prefixed by an abbreviation of the source module
   
   ```SystemVerilog
	// From io_request_queue
	input scalar_t                ior_read_value,
	input logic                   ior_rollback_en,
	
	// From control registers
	input scalar_t                cr_creg_read_val,
	input thread_bitmap_t         cr_interrupt_en,
	input scalar_t                cr_fault_handler,
   ```

- Instantiate srams using sram_1r1w and sram_2r1w
- Use always_ff and always_comb to avoid inferred latches or sensitivity list bugs.
- Signals often use the following suffixes:

   |Suffix|Meaning |
   |------|--------|
   | _en  | Use for a signal that enables some operation. Internal enables are always active high. |
   | _oh  | One-hot. No more than one signal will be set, corresponding to the index |
   | _idx | Signal is an index. Usually used when one-hot signals of the same name are also present |
   | _t   | Typedef |
   | _gen | Generated block |
   | _nxt | Combinational logic that generates the next value (input) for a flop.  Used to distinguish the input from the output of the flop |

- Don't use translate_off/translate on.  There is a macro SIMULATION that can be used
  where necessary (this should be rare).
- Use unique and unique0 in front of case statements wherever appropriate. Don't use
  full_case/parallel_case pragmas.
- assert should only be used inside an always_ff and shouldn't be reachable when reset
  is high. Otherwise it may be tripped incorrectly.
